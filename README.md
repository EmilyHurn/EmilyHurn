Hi, I’m @EmilyHurn

I am currently a Sophomore at the College of Charleston pursuing a B.S. of Computer Science
with a minor in Data Science. At the college, I am also a member of the cyber security and cyber
defense team who has participated in several competitions such as HIVESTORM, NCL, PCDC, and SECCDC.

I am currently unsure exactly what feild I would like to specialize in, but I have taken an 
interest in data science as well as cyber security.
